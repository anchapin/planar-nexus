## Core Features:

- Deck Builder: Create and edit Magic: The Gathering decks using an integrated card search and data from the Scryfall API, including card images and details.
- AI Deck Coach: An AI tool that evaluates the user's constructed deck, identifies potential synergies or weaknesses, and offers suggestions for card substitutions or strategy adjustments.
- Single Player Mode: Practice gameplay against a configurable AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels or utilize a 'self-play' mode to test deck interactions.
- 4-Player Commander Multiplayer: Connect with up to three other players in a 4-player Commander game using a P2P 'Listen Server' architecture with integrated matchmaking through a free tier service like Steamworks, handling NAT punch-through and basic game state synchronization.
- Deck Import/Export: Allow users to import and export decklist data (e.g., in a common format like plain text or CSV) to share or back up their custom decks.

## Style Guidelines:

- A dark color scheme invoking a sense of arcane strategy and depth. Primary interactive elements will use a deep violet (#721CC7). The main background will be a desaturated purplish-gray (#2B263B) to provide a rich canvas for card art and text. An accent vibrant blue (#3B75FF) will highlight key actions and emphasize focus.
- Headlines and prominent UI text will utilize 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, slightly tech-infused feel. Body text, card descriptions, and rule details will use 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure high readability and neutrality for comprehensive strategic information.
- Custom icon sets for Magic: The Gathering-specific elements such as mana symbols, card types (creature, instant, etc.), and battlefield zones (library, graveyard). Icons will be clean, scalable, and immediately recognizable to enhance game clarity.
- A structured and functional multi-panel layout designed for digital tabletop play, clearly segmenting zones for the battlefield, players' hands, graveyards, libraries, and commander zones. Player vital information (life totals, commander damage) will be persistently visible and intuitive.
- Subtle, non-disruptive animations will accompany card plays, targeting declarations, stack resolution, and turn transitions. These visual cues will enhance feedback and clarify game state changes without delaying gameplay or feeling overly flashy.
